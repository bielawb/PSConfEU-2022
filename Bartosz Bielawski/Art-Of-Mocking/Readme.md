# Slides and demos from session "The art of mocking"
*Working in IT may feel like an action movie at times. Do you press the enter, or not? Do you cut the blue wire, or the red one? Fortunately, we have Pester to test both wires. And there canâ€™t be a good test without correct mocking of the reality. In this session, I will share some hints how to make sure that your mocks make sense. How to make sure that when you cut the wrong wire in your tests, at least your mock is exploding (and nobody gets hurt).*
